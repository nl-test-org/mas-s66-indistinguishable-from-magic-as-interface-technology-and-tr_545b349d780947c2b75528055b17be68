| 6 | **Dragon Rising Game  {{< br >}}**  {{< br >}}This game design assignment is inspired by the study of Dungeons & Dragons and its [game mechanics and history](https://speakerdeck.com/gregab/the-pre-history-of-d-and-d-play-simulation-and-storytelling-in-1500-years-of-war-games). The goal of this group assignment is to give students experience using game mechanics to depict a particular storytelling idea or setting.  {{< br >}}_  {{< br >}}Guidelines:  {{< br >}}_Design a game based on the idea of training a dragon. Feel free to use dice, cards, coins, role-playing, and any other game ingredients to do this. Be sure to include iterative play-testing as a part of your process. {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Apply the principles of this week's lecture to your midterm project. {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  |

For this assignment, build your own Twitter bot using [this tutorial](http://atduskgreg.github.io/bother/ide.html), which was created using an open source software tool called Bother. {{< br >}}{{< br >}} For more information on the source code of this tutorial and examples of interesting bots, read [Bother – A One-Page Framework for Learning Bot-Making](https://github.com/atduskgreg/bother). {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Create your final project proposal. {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  |

| 12 | No design exercise for this session. Final project and presentation due this session.  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}_Student Work Example_   {{< br >}}{{< br >}} [Emergence &#124; A trick in 3 Parts](http://magic.jonathanbobrow.com/?p=95) – final project by Jonathan Bobrow  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} For my final project, I wanted to string a narrative between the disparate projects I had been working on throughout the semester. A growing fascination with emergent behavior and biologically inspired interactions led me to develop some simple tools for exploring these phenomena, both for real investigation as well as some fun with a supposed investigation. When mentioning emergence with regard to design, behavior, or systems, I am always asked for clarification, so it only seemed natural to discuss the concept of emergence and have some fun with it. {{< br >}}{{< br >}}
